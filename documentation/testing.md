# Testing

## Setup
To write and run the tests that ensure the correctness in this plugin I am using the library [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
Some tests require schema matching for which I am using [TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox).

### Structure
All the tests live in the `/test` directory.
Different types of tests live in their own subdirectory:
- `/unit` for unit tests
	- Unit tests are written for each of the plugins functions to make
- `/e2e` for end-to-end tests
	- @ToDo
- `/integration` for integration tests
	- @ToDo
